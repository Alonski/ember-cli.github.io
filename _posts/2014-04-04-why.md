A good browser framework is important. But building ambitious web applications also require excellent tooling and process: 
transpilers, asset compilation, fingerprinting, addons are just a few common ingredients. Ember-CLI wrap all of this 
(and much more) into a developer-friendly command-line package.

Instead of starting from scratch on new project Ember-CLI provides a set of carefully hand-picked defaults coupled with
powerful mechanisms for customization.

By sharing the tooling infrastructure that Ember-CLI and its addons provide, members of the Ember.js ecosystem can spend more time on the things that make their individual applications unique.
