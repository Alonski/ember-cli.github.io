A good browser framework is important. But building ambitious web applications also requires excellent tooling and processes.
Ember CLI wraps all of this (and much more) into a developer-friendly command-line package.

Among the principal features of Ember CLI are:

* Project/Addon creation: create new projects quickly without having to worry about project structure;
* Build pipeline: asset compilation, finger-printing and more out of the box;
* Generators: use the built-in generators and get files that follow the latest practices, and matching tests;
* Ember Addons: extend both your application and Ember CLI itself with community solutions.

By sharing the tooling infrastructure that Ember CLI and its addons provide, members of the Ember.js ecosystem can spend more time on the things that make their individual applications unique.
