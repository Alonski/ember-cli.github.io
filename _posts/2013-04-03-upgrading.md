### Upgrading an Ember CLI App

You may upgrade Ember CLI separately from Ember.js and Ember Data!

To upgrade your projects using yarn run:

```bash
yarn upgrade ember-cli
```

To upgrade your projects using npm run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev ember-cli
```

After running the upgrade command run ember init inside of the project directory to apply the blueprint changes. You can preview those changes for applications and addons.

Steps to upgrade to the latest version of Ember CLI are also included with the
[release notes for each release](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/releases).
